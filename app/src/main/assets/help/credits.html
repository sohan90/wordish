    <h2>Sounds</h2>
    Some sounds in Wordish come from soundjay.com or from pacdv.com who have
    graciously made them available under a Creative Commons license.
    <h2>Dictionary</h2>
    The definitions displayed in Wordish come from wiktionary.com.
    <br/><br/>
    The words allowed in the game come from the tournament word list commonly
    used for crossword-style games, and supplemented with longer words taken
    from Wiktionary.
    <br/><br/>
    The definitions were extracted from the file of articles Wiktionary makes
    available for download, under a Creative Commons license.  We endeavored
    to make this extraction as error free as possible but some
    problems exist.  In addition to other problems there are several hundred
    words included in the tournament word list that are not defined in
    Wiktionary.  These appear to be mostly because of differing standards for
    what words qualify for inclusion.  We regret that we have no definitions
    for these words.
